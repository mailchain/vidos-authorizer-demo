The application SHALL allow users to customize the credential ID for each credential request, which becomes the DCQL credential `id` field.

#### Scenario: Default credential ID

- **WHEN** a user creates a credential request
- **THEN** the application SHALL pre-fill the ID field with a UUID
- **AND** the ID field SHALL be editable

The application SHALL display which credential sets reference each credential request.

#### Scenario: Credential used in credential sets

- **WHEN** a credential request is referenced by one or more credential sets
- **THEN** the credential request SHALL display an indicator showing which sets include it
- **AND** the indicator SHALL show the credential set IDs (e.g., "Used in: id-set, address-set")

#### Scenario: Add option to credential set

- **WHEN** a user adds an option to a credential set

### Requirement: Credential Set Options Configuration

The application SHALL allow configuring multiple options within each credential set, where each option can contain one or more credentials.

#### Scenario: Single credential per option (OR alternatives)

- **WHEN** a user creates options with one credential each
- **THEN** the DCQL output SHALL request any ONE of those credentials
- **AND** example: options [["mdl-id"], ["photo_card-id"]] means mDL ID OR photo card ID

#### Scenario: Multiple credentials per option (AND combination)

- **WHEN** a user creates an option with multiple credentials
- **THEN** the DCQL output SHALL require ALL credentials in that option together
- **AND** example: option ["cred1", "cred2"] means cred1 AND cred2

#### Scenario: Mixed options (OR of ANDs)

- **WHEN** a user creates multiple options with varying credential counts
- **THEN** the DCQL output SHALL request one complete option to be satisfied
- **AND** example: options [["pid"], ["reduced1", "reduced2"]] means PID OR (reduced1 AND reduced2)

#### Scenario: Visual OR separator between options

- **WHEN** a credential set has multiple options
- **THEN** the UI SHALL display an "OR" separator/divider between each option
- **AND** users SHALL clearly understand alternatives are separated by OR logic

#### Scenario: Inline help for OR/AND logic

- **WHEN** the credential sets section is displayed
- **THEN** brief help text SHALL explain the OR/AND logic
- **AND** the help text SHALL clarify that multiple options = OR, multiple credentials in one option = AND

### Requirement: Quick Add to Credential Set

The application SHALL allow users to quickly add credentials to sets from the credential request when credential sets exist.

#### Scenario: Add to set button visibility

- **WHEN** at least one credential set exists
- **THEN** each credential request SHALL display an "Add to set" button with icon
- **AND** the button SHALL NOT be visible when no credential sets exist

- **AND** the new option SHALL contain only that credential initially

### Requirement: Credential Set Validation
